## 🔒 Cybersecurity Expertise  

As an **Entry-level Cloud Cybersecurity Analyst** with a strong foundation in cloud security principles, I bring hands-on experience in safeguarding cloud infrastructures and identifying vulnerabilities.  

### Key Skills and Tools:
- **Threat Detection & Vulnerability Management**:  
  Proficient in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities using tools like:  
  - **Burp Suite**, **Metasploit**, **SQLmap**, **Acunetix**, **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, **Nessus**, and **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  

- **Cloud Security**:  
  - Proficient in managing **Google Cloud Platform** (IAM, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Logging).  
  - Implemented **identity and access controls**, **firewall rules**, and **data protection measures**.  
  - Ensured compliance with security standards through monitoring and documentation.  

- **Security Operations**:  
  - Expertise in **Incident Response**, **Compliance Lifecycle**, **Network Security**, and **Data Protection**.  

### Key Projects:  
1. **Data Breach Response and Recovery | Google Cloud Cybersecurity Capstone Project** (September 2024):  
   - Responded to a simulated data breach by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities (e.g., public bucket ACLs, open SSH/RDP ports).  
   - Remediated issues by creating secure instances, restricting public access, and implementing firewall rules.  
   - Ensured compliance with logging and monitoring practices.  

2. **Threat Analysis on Cloud Systems**:  
   - Simulated attacks and assessed defense mechanisms on Google Cloud Console.  
   - Designed secure architectures to protect sensitive data and applications.  

This section emphasizes my ability to protect infrastructures and respond to cybersecurity challenges effectively, making me a strong candidate for cloud security roles.
